#MiniJava Type Checker

This is a project I did for school. Check out the assignment description for full details of the assignment. 

I am proud to have finished this project so I decided to put it on github. The code I wrote is all in src -> main -> java
The typechecker tests each of the testcases in the testcases -> hw2 folder and makes sure that the file typechecks or doesn't.
